            <p class="description">ZICNACS is a passion project made by Evie Zick and Bode Anderson-Brown. In their free time, the two love getting crafty across the different mediums, including crochet, jewelry, and visual art. After finding a particular passion for creating jewelry, Evie and Bode decided to extend their hobby beyond themselves and start selling their crafts as fun gifts and trinkets.</p>

        <img src="images/1.png" alt="ABOUT EVIE: Hi! I'm Evie. I'm currently a student at UWEC studying communications with a multimedia minor. I've always loved the arts. Before I could even walk, I was wielding a crayon and letting my imagination run wild. My love for art began with drawing, and drawing has been my true medium for most of my life. As I've grown, I've started to explore more forms of art. This is where I found my passion for multimedia art, such as collaging and creating jewelry. I love graphic design and try to apply its principles to my works. I love bright colors and asymmetrical patterns, and I strive to add a bit of spunk into all that I do.">
        <img src="images/2.png" alt="ABOUT BODE: Hi, my name is Bode and I'm a Special Education and Inclusive Practices major at UW Eau Claire. I like doing art because it allows me to express myself and create visually appealing things. I prefer art that involves physically making things like collages or jewelry. I am a very hands-on person who loves a challenge, so in my free time I also love climbing. Like rock climbing, this sort of art is a puzzle to me.">
